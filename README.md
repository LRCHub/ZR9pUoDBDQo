Baby Queen Seventeen!

Oh, baby you're my light
Oh baby you're my sight
And tell me no more lies, I wanna say
to you
I saw you sing a song
No darling, I'm not wrong
You were the best around me and the
youngest too

Tell me not I'm a liar
Babe queen everteen
Every man every day is getting crazy
for you

Glossy lips like a fire
Seventeen evergreen
Looking like a big star everything you
do

Baby queen seventeen - baby queen
seventeen
Rock it down, to the ground, beating
your radio
Baby queen seventeen, baby queen
everteen
Slam yourself to the hell, no defense, is
your chance!
Baby queen seventeen - baby queen
seventeen
Rock it down, to the ground, beating
your radio
Baby queen seventeen, baby queen
everteen
Slam yourself to the hell, no defense, is
your chance!

Your golden age is now
You really don't know how
You're ready for the lions in the jungle
deep

My life goes on and on
Sometimes I feel alone
And this is better know as 'freaky
mental trip

Tell me not I'm a liar
Babe queen everteen
Every man every day is getting crazy
for you

Glossy lips like a fire
Seventeen evergreen
Looking like a big star everything you
do
Baby queen seventeen - baby queen
seventeen
Rock it down, to the ground, beating
your radio
Baby queen seventeen, baby queen
everteen
Slam yourself to the hell, no defense, is
your chance!
Baby queen seventeen - baby queen
seventeen
Rock it down, to the ground, beating
your radio
Baby queen seventeen, baby queen
everteen
Slam yourself to the hell, no defense, is
your chance!
Baby Queen Seventeen!
Baby Queen Seventeen!

Tell me not I'm a liar
Babe queen everteen
Glossy lips like a fire
Seventeen evergreen
Seventeen
Seventeen

Oh, baby you're my light
Oh baby you're my sight
And tell me no more lies, I wanna say
to you
I saw you sing a song
No darling, I'm not wrong
You were the best around me and the
youngest too

Tell me not I'm a liar
Babe queen everteen
Every man every day is getting crazy
for you

Glossy lips like a fire
Seventeen evergreen
Looking like a big star everything you
do

Baby queen seventeen
